## Hi, nice to meet you!

My name is Emily DeBoy and I'm a third year graduate student in the human genetics and MD-PhD program. I'm originally from Columbia MD and went to the University of Maryland College Park for undergrad. I have a bachelor's in math/statistics and some coursework in programming but don't have much experience applying that knowledge in a research setting, I actually spend almost all my time in a wet lab. I'm hoping to gain a better understanding of how to perform reproducible statistical analyses in R to use in my future work.

Sorry I don't like talking about myself that much so I included a picture of my family's dog on vacation instead
